## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Write comprehensive docstrings in Google style
- Use f-strings for string formatting

### Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for development
- Create pull requests for each major feature
- Require code review before merging
- Use semantic versioning for releases

### Testing Strategy
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Write unit tests for all components
- Write integration tests for complex interactions
- Use pytest for testing

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Provide usage examples
- Create tutorials for common use cases
- Keep documentation in sync with code

## Resources Required

### Development Tools
- Python 3.8+ development environment
- Git version control
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- pytest for testing
- black and flake8 for code formatting and linting
- sphinx for documentation generation

### Third-party Libraries
- requests for HTTP requests
- pandas for data manipulation
- numpy for numerical operations
- matplotlib and plotly for visualization
- ta-lib for technical analysis (optional, can be reimplemented)
- scipy for optimization algorithms
- click for CLI interface

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. **API Changes**: External data sources might change their APIs
   - Mitigation: Abstract data source interfaces, implement adapters
   
2. **Performance Issues**: Large datasets might cause performance problems
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, pagination, and efficient data processing
   
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Breaking changes might affect existing users
   - Mitigation: Maintain backward compatibility layer, provide migration guide
   
4. **Scope Creep**: Project scope might expand during implementation
   - Mitigation: Stick to the defined scope, create backlog for future improvements

### Contingency Plans
- Define fallback data sources for critical functionality
- Create performance benchmarks to catch regressions
- Allocate buffer time for unexpected challenges
- Prioritize core functionality over nice-to-have features

## Future Enhancements (Post-MCP)

After the initial MCP implementation, consider these enhancements:

1. **Additional Data Sources**
   - Add support for international markets
   - Integrate alternative data sources
   
2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Implement machine learning models for prediction
   - Add sentiment analysis from news and social media
   
3. **Real-time Data**
   - Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates
   - Create streaming data processing pipeline
   
4. **Web Application**
   - Develop a web dashboard using Flask or FastAPI
   - Create RESTful API for the library

5. **Mobile Application**
   - Develop a mobile app for monitoring portfolios
   - Implement push notifications for alerts

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to refactoring the vnstock project into a Modern Component Portfolio architecture. By following this plan, the project will benefit from improved modularity, maintainability, and extensibility while maintaining backward compatibility for existing users.

The phased approach allows for incremental improvements and continuous testing, reducing the risk of regressions. Regular code reviews and comprehensive testing will ensure the quality of the refactored codebase.
